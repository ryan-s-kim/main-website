    <h1>Detailed View: Vietnam-Era ALICE Pack with Frame</h1>

    <p id="highlight">
        This <strong>genuine military-issue ALICE pack</strong> is complete with its original 
        <em>heavy-duty aluminum frame</em>. It features an interior waterproof liner 
        to keep gear dry, and three exterior pouches with drainage grommets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shoulder straps have adjustable padding, and the pack is designed 
        to distribute weight evenly for long-distance carrying. 
        While some packs have been modernized, collectors highly prize 
        the Vietnam-era originals like this one.
